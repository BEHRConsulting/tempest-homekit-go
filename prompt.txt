I need a service application written in go to monitor my tempest weather station and update apple homekit so I can script actions based on the current temp, humidity, rain, wind, and air preassure?. my data key's name is "tempest-homekit" and the token is "b88edc78-6261-414e-8042-86a4d4f9ba15"

If the option --loglevel is provided, the app should set the logging level accordingly. The default logging level should be "error", but it can be set to "debug" or "info" based on the user's preference.

When log level is debug, log the temp, humidity, wind speed, and rain each time it is read from api

Add a modern styled Web Dashboard: Local web interface for monitoring. Show any HomeKit information. Clicking on temp, should change from degrees C to degrees F. Clicking on wind speed should change from mph to kph, clicking on rains should change from in to mm. wind display should include direction

Create unit tests.

There should be no panics.

The app should handle errors gracefully, providing clear messages if something goes wrong, such as authentication failures, network issues, or file system errors. Error output should be sent to stderr.

The code should be well-structured and modular, making it easy to maintain and extend in the future.

The app should include comments and documentation to explain the functionality and usage. 

Generate a pretty REQUIREMENTS.md

Perform a code review and send output to CODE_REVIEW.md

The README.md file should follow GitHub standards

Update REQUIREMENTS.md to include enough information it can be used as a prompt to generate this app
